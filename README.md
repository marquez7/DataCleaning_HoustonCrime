# DataCleaning_HoustonCrime
Here I am trying to show the process of data cleaning using python. I got my data set from the City of Houston Crime Reports (https://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/Monthly_Crime_Data_by_Street_and_Police_Beat.htm)
You can visit the city of houston website to get more specific infomration regarding the crime reports. I have attached the specific files to this repo so you can download them if you prefer to not
go to the Houston website and just want to work with the data set.
