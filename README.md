# DataCleaning_HoustonCrime
Here I am trying to show the process of data cleaning using python.
I got my data set from the City of Houston Crime Reports. The data can be obtained for free
by downloading it from here: https://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/Monthly_Crime_Data_by_Street_and_Police_Beat.htm
